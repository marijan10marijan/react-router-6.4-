# React Router Dom V6.4 

### React-router-dom 6.4 have some new changes which I include in this Project.  
Instead of BrowserRouter, we use createBrowserRouter and change Routes with createRoutesFromElements.

### Imports we need: 
import { createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, Route, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";


### After creating routes, we need to place the router variable inside the return statement of our components using Router Provider.
